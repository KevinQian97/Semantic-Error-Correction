Lustrous (shiny)
Good conductors of heat and electricity
High melting point
High density (heavy for their size)
Malleable (can be hammered)
Ductile (can be drawn into wires)
Usually solid at room temperature (an exception is mercury)
Opaque as a thin sheet (can't see through metals)
Metals are sonorous or make a bell-like sound when struck
Have 1-3 electrons in the outer shell of each metal atom and lose electrons readily
Corrode easily (e.g., damaged by oxidation such as tarnish or rust)
Lose electrons easily
Form oxides that are basic
Fave lower electronegativities
Are good reducing agents
Not lustrous (dull appearance)
Poor conductors of heat and electricity
Nonductile solids
Brittle solids
May be solids, liquids or gases at room temperature
Transparent as a thin sheet
Nonmetals are not sonorous
Nonmetal Chemical Properties
Usually have 4-8 electrons in their outer shell
Readily gain or share valence electrons
Form oxides that are acidic
Have higher electronegativities
Are good oxidizing agents
